# We want to initially move fast towards the local minimum and as we approach it, we want to move slower
# To this end, there are various learning rates policies available:
#  fixed: always return base_lr.
#  step: return base_lr * gamma ^ (floor(iter / step))
#  exp: return base_lr * gamma ^ iter
#  inv: return base_lr * (1 + gamma * iter) ^ (- power)
#  multistep: similar to step but it allows non uniform steps defined by stepvalue
#  poly: the effective learning rate follows a polynomial decay, to be zero by the max_iter: return base_lr (1 - iter/max_iter) ^ (power)
#  sigmoid: the effective learning rate follows a sigmod decay: return base_lr * ( 1/(1 + exp(-gamma * (iter - stepsize))))
